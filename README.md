# Bomberman :bomb::boom:

<p>This project aims to create a grid where "bombs" will be implemented randomly in the first move. Afterwards, this grid will be completely filled with bombs. The first bombs will explode in order to cause damage to neighboring positions (side, top and bottom). What remains of bombs will go through the same process. The user must inform the grid size and the duration of the program (in seconds), with each explosion generation occurring in three seconds.</p>
